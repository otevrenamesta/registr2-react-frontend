# Register 2.0 react based web client

Uses [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/) for state management ( => stateless react components).
For debug pusposes (and later testing) uses [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create fake API.

## Install

```
npm i
```

## Run

It uses makefile. To start both fakeServer and webpack-dev-server issue:

```
make run
```
